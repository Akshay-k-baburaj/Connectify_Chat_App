# Connectify

A platform Designed for Seamless Connections

## Getting Started

Connectify is a cross-platform chat application designed to offer a seamless and secure
messaging experience. Developed using Flutter and integrated with Firebase, the application
provides real-time communication across Android, web platforms. Connectify leverages
Firebase's cloud-based infrastructure to deliver features such as user authentication, message
synchronization, media sharing.

The primary goal of the project is to enable users to communicate effortlessly while ensuring
privacy and security through Firebase's authentication and database services. Users can
register, log in, and engage in conversations with one another, sharing text, images, and files.
The application includes a search functionality, allowing users to search for others based on
their email and initiate chats. Furthermore, only users the individual has interacted with are
displayed on the home page, streamlining the user experience.

## Tools and Technologies
1. Flutter:- Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used for
